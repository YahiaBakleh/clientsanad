### As developer 
This is my 1st app with flutter it still need inhance in code quality and refactoring to separate backe-end code from UI üòí  but it stills work üëç
so expect to see a lot of if(somthing != null){...} where it should be if(!somthing){...} or or if(coondition) for single line inside
